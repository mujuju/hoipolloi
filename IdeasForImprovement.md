# Future Ideas #
  * Be able to right click on Birthdays Next Month and Print Envelopes
  * Might want to fix some bad habits, http://www.odi.ch/prog/design/newbies.php
  * Use http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/ for an easier way to launch HP on win32.
  * Have Timeclocks show times in addresses stored in Hoi Polloi.
  * Show Title in Greek on Title Bar
  * On filter list, double click name to edit profile, or right click to edit profile.
  * This image cropper has scroll wheel zoom and also a cool effect to blur the area of the image outside of the crop window, would be nice to implement. http://swing-fx.blogspot.com/2008/04/swing-component-to-crop-images.html

# v1 #
  * ~~Set the Search function to update the view list~~
  * ~~Add filter JTree functionality to filter the list of people~~
  * ~~Add/Edit/Delete addresses~~
  * Clean up the interface by removing unnecessary objects (eg. DualListBox.java, Cropping.java)
  * Ability to add and delete Categories
  * Ability to add/remove People from/to Categories (Drag & Drop)
  * ~~Show time until next birthday (PHP Code needs conversion)~~

  * ~~Update the PeopleList when you use QuickAdd~~
  * ~~Add System Tray functionality on OSs that support System trays~~
  * The NickName textbox on Edit Profile needs a label.
  * For people who can't middle click (laptops), should do something else for the actions for contacts, like control click or double click or something. May be even just single left click. Have to think about that.
  * Birthdays that have passed this month, or prev month show getComingAge should show getCurrentAge in the FilterTree.
  * QuickAdd: Hide New Category Box until New Category is selected.
