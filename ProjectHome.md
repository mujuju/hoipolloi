Hoi Polloi is a 21st century subject database program. Its main purpose to keep record of everyone one could possibly know in a meaningful and organized way. By having a program that is cross-platform, you can keep all your contact information for everyone you know in one place. The software is designed to be run from a local computer or a USB thumb drive. We realize this software might not be useful for most people, but some out there know hundreds of people, and meet new people (business relationships, networking, etc) everyday that they need to keep up with. A business could use Hoi Polloi to profile its employees, for HR purposes, etc.

Subjects can be put into multiple groups for sorting. Everything about a person can be stored, things like birthdays for example, where you can pull up a list of all the people with birthdays in the current month. Groups can be exported to excel files for easy mail merging.

Future features we would like to have are to synchronize one's contacts from their cellphone via Bluetooth, that way if you lose your phone or it is stolen, you don't lose your contacts and can easily upload them to your new phone. This is the biggest anxiety of people who lose their cellphone, all they want is their contacts back. Other features might be to send email directly from the program to individuals or groups of contacts, Import and Export contacts from Excel/CSV files, a built-in photo crop editor to choose a profile picture for each person, integrate contact information with Mapquest or Google Maps, Skype/Jaxtr, interface in multiple languages etc.
